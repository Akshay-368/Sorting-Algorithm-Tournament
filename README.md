# 🏆 Algorithm Arena: Sorting Tournament with ML Commentary

## 📌 Project Overview

**Algorithm Arena** is a fun, visual, and data-driven project that pits classic and meme-worthy sorting algorithms against each other in a tournament-style competition. The system benchmarks their performance on various types of datasets and uses machine learning to predict outcomes—acting as a live commentator during matches.

This solo project combines algorithmic analysis, real-time visualizations, data logging, and ML-based predictions, making it both technically deep and creatively engaging.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Simulate a tournament** where sorting algorithms compete head-to-head.
- **Measure and compare performance metrics** like time, comparisons, swaps, and memory usage.
- **Visualize the sorting process in real-time** for a more interactive experience.
- **Train a machine learning model** on the results to:
  - Predict the winner of a match based on input characteristics.
  - Serve as a "commentator" offering predictions and insights during matches.
- **Explore performance under different input conditions:** random, sorted, reversed, and nearly sorted arrays.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🎮 **Tournament Engine:** All-vs-all matchups across different dataset types.
- 📊 **Real-Time Visualizations:** Dynamic bar animations to show how each algorithm sorts.
- 📁 **Data Logging:** Automatically logs performance metrics into CSV files for ML analysis.
- 🤖 **ML Commentator:**
  - Trained using scikit-learn or other models.
  - Predicts the likely winner and provides confidence scores.
- 🧪 **Meme Algorithms:** Includes fun implementations like Bogosort, BozoSort, and SleepSort.
